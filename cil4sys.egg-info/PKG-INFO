### Description 
LPDR (License Plate Detection and Registration) is an automated application designed to identify and register car license plates within parking areas.  

 The primary function of LPDR involves the detection of license plates, which are subsequently recorded for billing purposes.  
This application employs a multi-stage approach, utilizing both video and image processing techniques, to accurately extract 

Tunisian license plate numbers. However, it's important to note that the current version of LPDR is limited to recognizing numerical characters on license plates and does not have the capability to read non-numerical characters. 
### Features 
- Processing of video records  from the parking camera
- License Plate Detection: Utilizes computer vision techniques to accurately locate license plates in various conditions.
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Recognizes alphanumeric characters on license plates, converting visual data to readable text.
