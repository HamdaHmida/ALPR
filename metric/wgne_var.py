wgne_var.py 

Estimation of white Gaussian noise variance.
 
The module assume that the noise modelis additive white
Gaussian 
assuming that these coefficients mostly represent noise 
rather than image content.
These coefficients are typically located in the top-left corner 
of the DCT matrix
 
Args:
    - image         (numpy.nadarry)
    - block_size    (int)

Returns
    - mean           (float)
    - std_dev        (float)
