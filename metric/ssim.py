    Structural Similarity Index (SSIM):

    SSIM is a perceptual metric that evaluates the 
    structural similarity between two images.It 
    takes into account luminance,contrast, and
    structure, and values range from -1 to 1, 
    with higher values indicating better similarity

    Args:
        image_1    (numpy array): 
		image_2	   (numpy array):
            
    Returns:
        float : SSIM ratio factor.
